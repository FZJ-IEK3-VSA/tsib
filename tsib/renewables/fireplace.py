    """
    Creates the profile of the heating of wood ovens based on the outside
    temperature and the activity of the occupants. The profile is generated
    based on stochastics.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    temperature: pandas.Series(), required
        Outside temperature profile of the location.
    occ_act: pandas.Series(), required
        Series of values between 0 and 1 desribing the share of overall active
        occpants at every time step.
    n_ovens: int, optional (default:1)
        Number of ovens in the building.
    T_oven_on: int or float, optional (default:5.)
        Threeshold outside temperature [Â°C] when the oven is turned on.
    t_cool: int, optional (default:5)
        Number of timesteps till when the oven is cooled down again.
    fullloadSteps: int or float, optional (default:450)
        Resulting number of full load timesteps. Attention: This value is not
        exact since it is a stochastic profile generation.
    seed: int, optional (default:None)
        Seed required for reproduceability. 
        If none, it is completely random.
        
    Returns
    ----------
    load_profile: pandas.Series()
        Relative load profile of the ovens in kW/kWp.
